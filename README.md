# SemesterProject2 </br>
My Second year semester project.

## Description:
This is my second Semester Project. The task is to make a fully functional webpage out of the prototype made in Figma. I must make a kanban board and deploy the website when I am finished.
The website needs to be responsive on different screen sizes, WCAG and SEO compatible. The layout and usability were large focuses for this project.

The project itself was challenging. There were a lot of different areas of the API that I needed to use and finding the correct pathing for some items was very challenging. As well as this,
finding out what information was vital to pull from the API was very difficult sometimes.
